# Mediapipe-
Mediapipe implementation for hand detection
The core concept behind MediaPipe is the construction of a pipeline, which is composed of a series of processing nodes.One of the key features of MediaPipe is its support for real-time processing.This makes it suitable for applications that require low-latency processing, like augmented reality, gesture recognition, or object tracking.

MediaPipe provides a wide range of pre-built components and models that cover various tasks, including face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, object detection, and more. Additionally, MediaPipe offers tools for visualizing and debugging the pipeline, making it easier to understand and optimize the processing flow.

In the field of computer vision, perception pipelines typically involve processing visual data, such as images or video frames, to understand and extract relevant information. The pipeline may consist of several stages, each performing specific tasks sequentially or in parallel.
